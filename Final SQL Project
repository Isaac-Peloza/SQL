#Down below are questions I asked myself about the database and answered using SQL.
##The database I used is called "Chinook" from Kaggle

#1.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != "USA";

#2.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#3.
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#4.
SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

#5.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;
