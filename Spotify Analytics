#This project I made by downloading Spotify data from Kaggle.
#Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
#Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#First thing I did was determine the artists popularity in descending order and limit by 15 artists max.
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 15;

#Then I wanted to know the max duration of a song with the track name and the artist with it.
SELECT MAX(duration_ms), track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
LIMIT 1;

#Lastly I determined the top 10 average energy, liveness, and loudness by artist name and track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(energy), avg(liveness), avg(loudness)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY artist_name desc
LIMIT 10;
